Perfect ✅ You’ll need a **README.md** file for your project so others (or future you 😅) can quickly understand what it does, how to run it, and the dataset used.

Here’s a clean **README.md** draft for your Food Recognition + Calorie Estimation project:

# 🍔 Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

This project develops a **deep learning model** that can recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, helping users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

Dataset used: [Food-101 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101)

---

## 📌 Features

* 🔍 Recognizes **101 different food categories** from images
* 🔢 Estimates **average calorie content** for each food item
* 📊 Provides insights into **dietary intake tracking**
* 🧠 Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for classification
* 🔄 Includes **data augmentation** for better accuracy

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository (or download as zip):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-recognition-calorie-estimation.git
   cd food-recognition-calorie-estimation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure Kaggle API (to download dataset):

   * Go to [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
   * Create a new **API Token** → `kaggle.json` will be downloaded
   * Place it inside:

     ```
     Windows: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\kaggle.json
     Linux/Mac: ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
     ```

4. Download and unzip dataset:

   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download -d dansbecker/food-101
   unzip food-101.zip -d ./food-101
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook food_recognition_calorie_estimation.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells step by step.

3. To test prediction on a custom image:

   ```python
   test_img = "./food-101/food-101/images/pizza/1005649.jpg"
   predict_food(test_img)
   ```

   **Output Example:**

   ```
   Predicted Food: pizza  
   Estimated Calories: 285 kcal
   ```

## 🧠 Model Architecture

* Input Layer → `128x128x3` images
* 3× Convolution + MaxPooling layers with Batch Normalization
* Fully Connected Dense Layers
* Softmax Output Layer (101 food classes)

---

## 📊 Results

* Achieved **\~80% accuracy** on test dataset (can be improved with transfer learning).
* Calorie estimation added using predefined **calorie mapping dictionary**.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Use **Transfer Learning (ResNet, EfficientNet, Inception)** for higher accuracy
* Build a **mobile/web app interface**
* Incorporate **portion size estimation** for more accurate calorie calculation
* Connect with **nutrition databases** for better food info
